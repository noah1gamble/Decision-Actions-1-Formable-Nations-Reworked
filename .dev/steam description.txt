[b]UPDATES[/b] 
[i]This mod will ALWAYS stay updated![/i]

[b]LANGUAGE[/b] 
[i]This mod currently only supports English but will include more localisation as time goes on - recommend any, or accept a payment bounty and get paid to localise![/i]

[b]REGARDING CORES, DIFFICULTY & REQUIREMENTS[/b] 
[i]The Public Release Version currently only supports a hard-mode version which requires you to own all core lands of the nation you or the AI wish to form. The goal is to complete both the mod itself and the website and anything related to those for maximum functionality and support as well as to help the community understand the mod. Upon completion of those goals there will be specific versions such as vanilla requirements and less demanding formations for people who wish to use those.[/i]
